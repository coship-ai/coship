### Option 2: Beyond Vibe Coding Hook
```
"Beyond vibe coding" isn't marketing speak.

Here's the difference:

Vibe Coding:
❌ Prompt → hope it works
❌ Copy-paste from ChatGPT
❌ Prototype-level quality
❌ 3-6 months of iteration

CoShip:
✅ Agentic workflow (Cowork + Skills)
✅ Notion PRDs → Linear issues → Code
✅ Production-ready best practices
✅ 2-4 weeks to MVP

@CoShip = Claude-powered, CTO-designed architecture.

$299 launch pricing. DM to chat. 🚢
```

---

### Option 3: The Process Thread
```
Your AI Co-Founder works like this:

𝟭. 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝗻
Claude Cowork creates your Notion PRD
Syncs to Linear for issue tracking
Structured like a real dev team would

𝟮. 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱
Claude Skills scaffold React + Tailwind + Supabase
Works issue-by-issue
Production-ready code, not prototypes

𝟯. 𝗦𝗵𝗶𝗽
Deploy to Vercel
CI/CD + preview deployments
Investor-ready from day one

This is @CoShip. 2-4 weeks. $299.

Like having a Fractional CTO 24/7 at 1% the cost. 🚢

## Key Messaging to Emphasize

### Core Differentiators (use these phrases):
- ✅ "AI co-founder" (not just AI tool)
- ✅ "Agentic workflow" (not random prompting)
- ✅ "Claude-powered" / "Powered by Claude"
- ✅ "Beyond vibe coding" (key differentiator)
- ✅ "Production-ready" (not prototypes)
- ✅ "2-4 weeks" (speed)
- ✅ "$299" (cost vs alternatives)
- ✅ "24/7" (availability)
- ✅ "1% of the cost" (vs Fractional CTO)
- ✅ "Cowork + Skills" (technical credibility)
- ✅ "React, Tailwind, Supabase" (modern stack)
- ✅ "Notion + Linear" (professional workflow)

### Avoid Generic AI Phrases:
- ❌ "AI-powered" (too generic)
- ❌ "Using AI" (vague)
- ❌ "With help from Claude" (downplays capability)
- ❌ "AI-assisted" (sounds like a helper, not co-founder)

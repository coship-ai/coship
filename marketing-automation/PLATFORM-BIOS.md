## Twitter Pinned Tweet

### Option 1: Origin Story (Recommended)
```
I spent 15 years building products for other people.

Now I'm building something to help YOU build yours.

@CoShip helps non-technical founders go from idea → MVP in weeks, not months.

No code bootcamps. No agency runarounds. No equity-hungry "technical co-founders."

Just your vision, shipped. 🚢
```

---

### Option 2: Problem-Solution
```
You have a great idea.
You know it could work.
But you don't know how to build it.

Sound familiar?

I watched this happen for 15 years as a CTO. Brilliant founders stuck because the technical barrier was too high.

That's why I built @CoShip. AI-assisted development + human expertise = your MVP shipped.

No code bootcamps. No sketchy agencies. No giving up half your company.

DM me if you want to talk about what you're building. 🚢
```

---

### Option 3: Direct Value Prop
```
@CoShip in 3 sentences:

1. You describe your product idea
2. We build your MVP using AI + experienced engineers
3. You launch in weeks, not months

No technical skills needed.
No equity deals.
Fixed pricing.

First 20 customers: $299 (then $499).

Building in public. DMs open for questions. 🚢

### About Section (2600 char limit - keep it concise)

```
I spent 15 years as an engineer and technical leader, building products for startups and enterprises.

Throughout that career, I watched brilliant non-technical founders struggle—not because their ideas weren't good, but because the technical barrier was too high.

They'd either:
• Burn through savings on agencies that didn't understand their vision
• Partner with technical co-founders who didn't share their passion
• Give up entirely on ideas that deserved to exist

That frustration became my mission: Make it dramatically easier for non-technical founders to bring their ideas to life.

**That's why I built CoShip.**

CoShip combines AI-assisted development with experienced engineering oversight to help founders go from idea to working MVP in weeks, not months.

No code bootcamps. No equity-hungry co-founders. No agency runarounds. Just your vision, shipped.

---

**What I believe:**
• Ideas deserve a chance—the best products often come from people who deeply understand a problem, not from those who know how to code
• Technical complexity shouldn't be a moat—the tools exist now to democratize building
• Speed matters, but so does quality—a rushed MVP that breaks isn't an MVP, it's a liability

---

If you're a non-technical founder with an idea, or if you're just curious about what we're building, I'd love to connect.

DMs are open. Let's talk about what you're building. 🚢
